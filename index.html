<!-- CSS RULES
1. Content is Everything
2. Order set by code.
3. Children sit on parents

POSITION:
-Static (default): go along with the html rules and keep default html flow

-Relative: position element relative to how it wouldve been positioned while
static.

  ex: img{
  position: relative
  left: 30px
  }
      relative positioning does not affect the position of any other element.

-Absolute: we are positioning the element relative to its parent.
          adding a margin to its parent element. Absolute positioning
          will affect the flow of your html.
example:
div{
  position: Relative
}
img{
  position: Absolute
  right: 30px;
}

-Fixed: Keeps element in place on screen when scrolling.

      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My name is Michael. I am a student studying full-stack web development at Helio Training with the
        aspirations
        of launching a career in the industry. I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of structuring and designing websites. 
        I love to learn and I am an avid reader!</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>Once I was exposed to the world of programming I became fascinated by it! I took a few tech
          courses in college, but I decided to fully immerse myself in a coding bootcamp to accelerate my path
          into the industry. I am
          learning how to develop full-stack applications using technologies like React, Express, and MongoDB. I have
          much to learn and explore but I look forward to what lies ahead and embrace the opportunity!

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>Books provide us with an incalcuable amount of information and that is why I love to read.
          Reading allows me to constantly expose myself to new material and challenge my existing worldview. There is so much to learn in life and through reading we can explore varying ideas and perspectives. A couple of my favorite books are <i>"The Stranger"</i> by Albert Camus
          and Plato's <i>"Republic"</i>.</p>
